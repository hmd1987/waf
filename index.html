Without a Face was founded in 2004 as a high school band, then grew into a college band, and then it shrunk into a singer-songwriter "project" which signed with Redbird Records & Touring.
WAF released two albums through Redbird Records, "Worst Debut Album Ever" in 2009 and then "The 1st Album Was Better" in 2010 

WAF parted ways with Redbird Records in 2011 and went on to self-release "5 Songs (EP)" in 2011, "Oh, Great, An Election (EP)" in 2012 and then the third-full length album, "The American Scheme" in 2013. After an involuntary departure from releasing music, Without a Face self-released a new song in 2018. 

Without a Face has been slowly but surely creating a lot of songs while keeping busy with other music projects such as an indie rock band known as "Paper Gliders" and a heavy metal project named "Perfect Little Robot".
