Without a Face was founded in 2004 as a high school band, then grew into a college band, and then it shrunk into a singer-songwriter "project" which signed with Redbird Records & Touring; releasing 2 albums through them in 2009 & 2010. 

WAF parted ways with Redbird Records in 2011 and on to self-release 2 EPs as well as a 3rd album between 2011 & 2013.
After an involuntary departure from releasing music, Without a Face self-released a new song in 2018. 

Without a Face has been slowly but surely creating a lot of songs while keeping busy with other music projects such as the indie rock band known as "Paper Gliders" and a heavy metal project labeled "Perfect Little Robot".
