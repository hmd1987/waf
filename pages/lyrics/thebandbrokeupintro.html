<h3>The Band Broke Up (Intro)</h3>
Well hey everyone. I am the kid that plays acoustic music
No drums, no bass, Without a Face is 2nd rate and out of place.
<br>
<br>
Don't gimme a chance, I ain't got a band.
Don't gimme a chance, I will understand.
Don't gimme a chance, I ain't got a band.
Don't gimme a chance, I'm only one man.
<br>
<br>
It didn't take work to write these words.
Time to get a tie, take me to my hearse.
All by myself on my little stage.
Talk amongst yourselves while I just play.
<br>
<br>
Don't gimme a chance, I ain't got a band.
Don't gimme a chance, Don't you dare dance.
Don't gimme a chance, I ain't got a band.
Don't gimme a chance, oh don't you clap your hands.
<br>
<br>
Oh, this it isn't really working out at all. Not at all.
Oh, this it isn't really working out at all. I feel so small.
Since the band broke up before we put an album out.
The band broke up, I wish I hadn't broken it up now.
No, no, no.
<br>
<br>
Don't gimme a chance, I ain't got a band.
Don't gimme a chance Papa Roach fans.
<br>
