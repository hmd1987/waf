	<h3>Anchorbabe Stalker</h3><b>
Miss Lucy Noland, you're a scream.
You said you cook Vietnamese cuisine.
I am more of a bacon burger boy,
but for you I think I'd eat anything.
<br><br>
You are quite a globe-trotting girl.
Alaska, New York, California; what a small world.
Don't get creeped out, babe, I don't stalk you that much.
It's just that you make my brain twirl.
<br><br>
Just one date. That's all I ask.
I hope it's not too trying of a task.
Just one date. That's all I ask,
and then I'll let the world have you back.
<br><br>
I don't wanna go all anchorman on you.
Miss Noland, you can slap me if I do.
I'm not kind of a big deal, but if you gimme a shot, 
I think that I could be, it's true.
<br><br>
and I can't say that I'm a Tigers fan,
I mean Kid Rock Detroit does what it can,
but with Enron, Anna (Nicole Smith), Dis-astros,
and the smog; Houston is a magical land.
<br><br>
Just one date. That's all I ask.
I hope it's not too trying of a task.
Just one date. That's all I ask,
and then I'll let the world have you baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
<br>
..No I won't, but if you want me to I will,
But if you don't; what a happy man I will be.
<br><br>
KHOU Anchor-girl, you're my world,
you make me say ooh-la-la.
KHOU Anchor-girl, you're my world,
you make me say, "Please let me be your anchor-man."</b>
