<h3>Fratford Bratford '06'</h3>
<b>
<em>***Acoustic punk rock***</em><br>
Graduated from a mighty fine factory.
Cookie cutter copycat personality.
So many clones so little time,
I just need space to breath in between festivities.
<br><br>
Have spirit for the school that you're zoned in.
Put on your backwards hat and you'll be ownin'.
Its just an area I happen to be born in.
You can try but I'm afraid there's no escape..
<br><br>
From Fratford oooh
B-Bratford '06
<br><br>
Check your breath there's ladies too impress (ooh).
Name brand logos elevate you among the best.
So many tools I feel like I'm in construction.
Ladies have a solid self-destruction.
<br><br>
Polo shirts and really tight mini skirts.
Fake bake to the top, hey whatever works.
Superficial is the road, sometimes it hurts.
Sorry babe, but I'm afraid there's no escape..
<br><br>
From Fratford oooh
B-Bratford 06
Fratford aaah
B-Bratford 06
<br><br>
My high school community. Land of conformity.<br>
Wheels on the bus go round and round,
I gotta go to a good college & get good grades,
So I can get a good job that gives good pay,
So I can buy a good wife & have good kids,
<br><br>
Fit for a good mid life crisis.
Feel low though payrolls got me the highest.
God I didn't want life just like this.
But then again what is there to do?
I owe it to myself yeah that is true.
<br><br>
That's why my venom has begun to spew.
Tell me why I got to measure up to you?
Any chance I can be myself please?
Without you saying, "Why isn't he just like me?"
<br><br>
I'm not a walking apology,
All I can cough up is that you're sorry
I wish you the best
I hope you're happy
<br><br>
And I hope you find escape from false security
Fratford ain't a place; it's a state of mind
Tick tock goes the clock running out of tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime
<br><br>
Fratford
B-Bratford '06'
<br><br>
***Cheer up. The worst is yet to come.***
