		<h3><u>The Band Broke Up (Part 2)</u></h3><b><br>
Bitter sweet taste
Had to make haste
But there's no poison in me
T'was a treasure
T'was a pleasure
My homeboys you'll always be
<br><br>
They don't hand out the lottery
You got to go buy a ticket
And even that's no garantee that you will even win it
I got one life
I'd rather die
Than not feel alive but stuck
The band broke up
<br><br>
there ain't no anger
Ain't no danger
I just feel abit free
I, myself, and me
<br><br>
You can't just sleep if you want your dreams to become
Your reality
And even if I'm clinging to straws
At least I jumped in the sea
I got to try
I've just one life
But still my decision sucks
<br><br>
The band broke up
Well technically I left
The band broke up
Only the band and my cat
The Band broke up
And I'm doing alright
The band broke up
Oh I'm doing just fine
The band broke up
Na na na na na na na
The band broke up
<br><br>
Looking back on it all now
I simply blame me
For having a revelation
I didn't help them see
Life solo's been rough
Since the band broke up
