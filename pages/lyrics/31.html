<h3><u>31</u></h3><b><br>
31 year young lady
You're a woman not a girl.
Most of the girls my age
Could learn something from you
And I could too.
31 year young lady
It is not that hard to say.
That I think you and I would be a good team
But I swallow my tongue anyway.
<br><br>
If there was a girl like you my age
If there was a girl like you my age
I would still be with you anyway
But Im eight years too late
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
<br><br>
I am willing to embarrass myself
Just to make you laugh.
Most of the times you and I exchange jokes
No one else in the room understands.
31 year young lady
Tell me how can I catch your brown eyes?
Sure enough just my luck you found another guy
But that is not a surprise.
<br><br>
If there was a girl like you my age
If there was a girl like you my age
I would still be with you anyway
Oh
<br><br>
I'm gonna build a time machine
Travel to 1979
Im gonna build a time machine
Itll be easier to make you mine
Or maybe I could age quicker
Or maybe you could become younger
If not, who cares that were so many years apart
Age is just a number
Yeah right
<br><br>
Girl you must be an astronaut
Girl you must be an astronaut
Girl you must be an astronaut
Girl you must be an astronaut
G-G-Girl you must be an astronaut
Girl you must be an astronaut
Girl you must be you must be you must
Cause youre out of this world
Take me to the moon
<br><br>
31 year young lady
My face is turning red
Turning red due to the cheesy pickup lines that I said
31 year young lady
You turned me down when I asked you on a date
But you and I and the whole world knows Im a sucker for you anyway
<br><br>
Im gonna build a time machine
Travel to 1979
Im gonna build a time machine
Itll be easier to make you mine
Or maybe I could age quicker
Or maybe you could become younger
If not, who cares that were so many years apart
Age is just a number
<br><br>
And when I was playing with Ninja Turtles
You were overcoming those teenage hurdles
While I was learning my ABCs
You were dividing x to the second by three
While you were stressing over final exams
Mom got mad at me for tearing holes in my pants
And if love sees no color
Love doesnt care about numbers
Darling I-I dont see any color
So I dont really care if youre
A 31 year young lady
31 year young lady
