		<h3><u>Druggie Love</u></h3><br>
		<b>
You were in the passenger seat
When you had asked me if Ive done hardcore drugs
A part of me thinks that if I told you yes
Maybe I wouldve earned your love
So if thats the case then everything Im about to tell you is true
<br><br>
It all started with a little sip of beer
Then another, then another til I couldnt see clear
So I smoked cigarettes and moved on to cigars
I decided my teeth are bad enough as they are
I wanted to lighten up so I drank hard liquor
Then what do you know I started looking even sicker
Weed and mushrooms might as well be my brothers
My drug dealer might as well be my own mother
<br><br>
Momma Im in love
That is just why I do drugs
If she wants a train wreck here I am
Going off the rails just to be her man
<br><br>
Yes I scour for heroine as if Im a vulture
Im not a rebel at all
I conform to my culture
So I took a lot of speed and Tylenol
On my way down from ecstasy I collapsed at the mall
Some jerk called an ambulance because he thought I was dead
The paramedics even put me in the ICU bed
Woke up and snorted cocaine
It went to my brain
Pink elephant told me Henry you are going insane.
<br><br>
Mr. Elephant Im in love
That is just why I do drugs
If she wants a train wreck here I am
Going off the rails just to be her man
<br><br>
Yeah and LSD is cool
But then I did codine
I gotta tell you nothings better than a slow motion spleen
They say Crystal method, it will kill you.
Well I did it twice so now I know it aint true
Ahhh oh no no no no no no oh no no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
<br><br>
Crack is whack
Thats not true its your friend
Quality time me and my crack pipe like to spend
On my acid trip you know I really couldve used a kiss
Abraham Lincoln had two heads and he was looking pretty pissed
Mr. President please
<br><br>
Mr. President Im in love
That is just why I do drugs
If she wants a train wreck here I am
Im not even gonna go to a 12 step program
<br><br>
Cause oh I love her so
Choo choo like Ralph Wiggum I choose you
Choo choo I hope that you choose me too
Choo choo Ill make you boohoo
Cause you know Ill love drugs more than you
<br><br>
But of course, if youre not attracted to boys that do drugs
Then I just want you to know that I dont do drugs
Or better yet, its you that changed me
And as of three hours ago I am completely clean and sober
And its all because of you.
